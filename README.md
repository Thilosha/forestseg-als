# forestseg-als
Tree segmentation and volume analysis platform using airborne LiDAR (ALS) data. Implements voxel-based 3D point cloud segmentation, clustering, and vertical traversal to individualize trees and estimate their biophysical attributes. Developed and tested in coordination with GreenValley International for LiDAR360 v9 beta forestry model validation.
